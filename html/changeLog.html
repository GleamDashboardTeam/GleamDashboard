The mask for aggregating country values was adjusted. This change will mostly affect countries and regions with a long coast line compared to the land area, and regions with many small islands and generally leads to slightly smaller values for some variables. 
A small glitch that affected the allocation of emissions related to pasture expansion was also fixed.

New regional aggregations are available. New regions were added: World Bank Economic Regions, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), EU27, Continents, and FAO Regions with their aggregated values. Please see the "Regions" link on the left menu. 

<h3> 2023-03-27 </h3>

A little problem with NA values in regional aggregation of input data (Manure managment and others), that caused some inconsitencies in regional aggregates, was fixed.

<h3> 2023-05-15 </h3>

New regional aggregations are available. New regions were added: Sustainable Development Goals Regions (SDGs), Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Least Developed Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs). Please see the "Regions" link on the left menu.

Total anthropogenic emissions were adjusted, to be aligned with those reported in FAOSTAT for “All sectors with LULUCF”, for the year 2015. Globally, this reduced the estimate of emissions (e.g. from 55 Gt CO2 to 51 Gt CO2, using GWP100 from IPCC AR6), resulting in slightly higher shares of emissions related to livestock on anthropogenic ones. The emission shares and total emissions are now reported with two significant figures.

For consistency with other data sets, the methodology to aggregate country data for animal population and production was changed, resulting in very small differences in animal numbers and production compared to the previous release. In addition, a technical issue was corrected that affected some the number of chickens in layer production systems for countries.
