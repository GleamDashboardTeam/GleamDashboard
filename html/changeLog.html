We have adjusted the mask for aggregating country values. This change will mostly affect countries and regions with a long coast line compared to the land area, and regions with many small islands and generally leads to slightly smaller values for some variables. We also fixed a small glitch that affected the allocation of emissions related to pasture expansion.

New regional aggregations are available. We added World Bank Economic Regions, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), EU27, Continents, and FAO Regions with their aggregated values. Please see the "Regions" link on the left menu.

We fixed a little problem with NA values in regional aggregation of input data (Manure managment and others) that caused some inconsitencies in regional aggregates.

<h3> 2023-05-15 </h3>

New regional aggregations are available. We added county regions for Sustainable Develop Goals (SDGs), Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Least Developed Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs). Please see the "Regions" link on the left menu.
