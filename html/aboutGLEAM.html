<h2> What is GLEAM?</h2>

The Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM) is a geospatial framework that simulates the bio-physical processes and activities within livestock systems, using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The aim of GLEAM is to quantify production and use of natural resources in livestock systems and to identify their environmental impacts. Estimating these impacts is essential to establish robust baselines, and to estimate the expected impacts of different livestock sector trends and actions to mitigate environmental impacts.
    GLEAM provides a systematic, global coverage of six livestock species and their edible products: meat and milk from cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats; meat from pigs; and meat and eggs from chickens. Further information on the methodology and the input data can be found on <a href=http://www.fao.org/gleam/en/> our website </a>.

<h2> GLEAM v3 Data</h2>
While GLEAM uses a spatially explicit model at 5 arc minutes pixel resolution, the results shown in this dashbaoard represent regional aggregates that mask considerable varations that exists across individual countries and even within countries. There is also a large range in data availability and data quality for different regions that results in very different reginonal uncertainties associated with the results.
This limitation need to be taken into account when interpreting data, in particular emissions and emission intensities. For example, using the regional emission intensities presented here to calculate life cycle emissions for a certain animal product in a given country might lead to a very misleading result that should not be used to draw conclusions on the emissions footprint of a certain product or to compare those footprints between countries. Similarly, these emission intensities may not appropriately represent the impacts associated with single companies or farms, as the input data used by the model may not be representative of their specific livestock breeding practices.
